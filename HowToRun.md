# How to Run the application
- From the directory root click on `run.sh` or run this command over CLI `sh run.sh`
- I have added the necessary settings to the `.env` file for both `Docker` and the `application`, so you don't need to make any changes. This ensures that the application has the required configurations to run smoothly.
